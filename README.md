📚 Library Management System (LMS)
Fully functional library management system with dunamic layout and web pages.
👉 A Library Management System is a software that helps manage the work of a library.

Think of a video game inventory system 🎒:
You can add items
You can search for items
You can borrow/use items
You can return items
A Library Management System does the same — but for books (or e-books, journals, etc.).

⚡ Core Features (MPV terms):
Add books 📕 → like adding new weapons/items in a game.
Search books 🔍 → like finding a sword in your inventory.
Issue books 🏷️ → like equipping an item.
Return books 🔄 → like putting the item back.
Track users 👩‍🎓 → who borrowed what, and when.

🏗️ Why useful?
Saves time ⏳ (no manual registers).

Easy to track everything ✅.

A Library Management System = Digital Inventory System for Books.
